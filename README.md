# Work-Day-Planner
This website is a app to help people plan their workday. Users are able to enter tasks into a text field and use a button to save them. The app is colour coded to show whether the times are in the past, present or future. It displays todays date at the top of the page.

# Challenges

This was my first project using jQuery. This presented a number of challenges. I needed to traverse the DOM using jQuery as well as using it for the logic. Trying to work out how to save data to each separate time block was difficult. Also using "this" was something I had not done much before.

# What I learned

I am a lot more confident with parent, siblings and children. I feel like I understand basic jQuery a lot more than I did before. It has made me more confident with local storage. I learned to use moment.js in a webpage.

Here is a screenshot of the application.
